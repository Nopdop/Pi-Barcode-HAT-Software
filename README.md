### Barcode HAT for Raspberry Pi is a robust and compact barcode scanner board that consists of a DE2120 scanner module, buzzer, 1.14‚Äù LCD screen, micro-USB port. It is designed to scan 20 different barcode symbologies in the segment of both 1D and 2D symbology like barcodes and QR codes.

## Setup Pi Barcode HAT
First, you need to change the mode of the Pi Barcode HAT. Put Barcode HAT at the top of the raspberry pi, then you need to scan the below barcode settings before running the code 
 * Mode is TTL/RS232 (serial communication interface(UART)) for this you need to scan below the barcode, Connect USB to pico barcode hat.

## Use Pi Barcode Hat without Raspberry Pi( Via USB Cable )
For this you need to scan below barcode settings
